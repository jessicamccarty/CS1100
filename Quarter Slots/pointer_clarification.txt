Why did I use pointers for quarters instead of creating a function?

By passing a pointer to quarters, updateBalance can directly modify the variable that main is using. If quarters were passed by value, the function would only work with a copy 
of the variable. Chaanges maade to this copy would not affect the original quarters variable in main.
